<a id="s1"></a><h2>Section 1 - Introduction</h2>

<a id="c1"></a><h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>
The Speech Synthesiser provides your Psion Organiser
with another output medium. By default it will read out
the text displayed on the screen, therefore it immediately
interfaces to all packages and applications you might
already have. It can also be made to read out text not
displayed on the screen, thereby increasing the amount
of information your Psion Organiser can present to you
at any one time.
</p>

<p>
The inbuilt dictionary of over 900 words includes principal
UK towns, colours, numbers, activities, error messages,
and these may be supplemented by a user defined dictionary
to provide further specialised vocabulary. The user
defined dictionary is constructed using the in-built
allophone editor. There is no restriction on the size of this
user vocabulary, other than the size of the datapack on
which it is held.
</p>

<p>
To summarise, the facilities provided are :-
</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Ability to read straight off the screen.
</li><li>In built vocabulary of over 900 words.
</li><li>Ability to add user defined vocabulary.
</li><li>Programmers interface.
</li></ol>

<a id="p1-2"></a>

<a id="c2"></a><h3>2. Installing the Speech Synthesiser Unit</h3>

<p>
To use the Speech Synthesiser, first switch off your
Organiser by selecting OFF from the top level menu. Slide
open the door at the top of the Organiser &amp; insert the
Speech Synthesiser unit into the socket, making sure it
slides in all the way until you feel a click. The unit will only
go in one way.
</p>

<p>
To load the Speech Synthesiser software into the
Organiser, press ON/CLEAR twice. The first press switches
the Organiser on and the second press loads the
software. The Speech Synthesiser is now ready for use
and a new menu option SPEECH, will have been inserted
into the main Organiser menu, just before the last option
OFF.
</p>

<p>
The Speech Synthesiser software occupies about 4k of
memory, so if the internal memory of the machine is
already nearly full, the OUT OF MEMORY message may
be displayed. If this happens, delete any non-vital files or
records from A: or use the TIDY option in the DIARY
to clear some memory, or move some files from A: to a
datapack.
</p>

<p>
If no error message is displayed &amp; the SPEECH option
does not appear, switch the machine off, remove the
Speech Synthesiser unit, carefully re-insert it &amp; try again.
</p>

<p>
The unit contains a socket for a mains adaptor lead. You
do not have to use a mains adaptor when using the Speech
Synthesizer but there are obvious advantages in doing so
whenever you are conveniently near a mains socket.
</p>

<a id="p1-3"></a>

<p>
The unit also contains a 3.5mm jack socket suitable for
connecting a headphones set - not supplied, but as
commonly used on personal stereo systems;. These
headphones could be of use when creating your own
vocabulary or at any other time when you don't wish the
unit to annoy other people !
</p>

<a id="c3"></a><h3>3. Removing the Speech Synthesiser Unit</h3>

<p>
After using the Speech Synthesiser unit, switch off the
Organiser by selecting OFF. To remove the unit from the
Organiser, press the click switch &amp; pull.
</p>

<p>
The software will still be stored in memory however, and
should be removed by pressing ON/CLEAR to switch the
machine back on, and at the top level menu, pressing
ON/CLEAR again. The SPEECH option should now
have disappeared from the main menu, and the memory
used by the speech synthesiser will have been freed for
other uses.
</p>

<p>
If the unit is unplugged during use, a DEVICE MISSING
error will be reported. For obvious reasons, this should
be avoided.
</p>

<p>
After removal of the Speech Synthesiser unit and software,
19 bytes of memory will remain allocated These 19
bytes contain your preferred setups, and are used to save
you having to configure the software each time you use
it. Details on how to free up these 19 bytes will be found
in the "Using Setup" section.
</p>

<a id="p1-4"></a>

<a id="c4"></a><h3>4. How it works</h3>

<p>
To make full and proper use of the synthesiser it would
help to have an understanding how it works.
</p>

<p>
Basically, there are 3 types of computer generated speech.
</p>

<p>
The first, pulse coded modulation (PCM), which is no
more than digital recording, storage and playback,
requires about 70,000 bits per second of speech. To say just
a few words using this method would require several
hundred thousand bytes of data. Although the Organiser
can now have over 1/2 mega-bytes "online" you can see
that this is not really an acceptable method for the vast
range of words that will need to be spoken in any particular
application.
</p>

<p>
The second method, linear predicting coding (LPC),
which predicts a speech sample from a weighted
combination of previous samples, requires only one to two
thousand bits per second of speech. Using this method,
approximately 15 words can be stored in 2k bytes of
memory. Again to create any reasonable vocabulary will
exhaust the capacity of the Organiser.
</p>

<p>
The final method, allophone synthesis, has the major
advantage of providing an unlimited vocabulary, since the
stored units are not words, but individual speech sounds
(allophones). These allophones are strung together to
form complete words. Although completely understandable,
the speech quality is not as good as it is for
PCM or LPC.
</p>

<a id="p1-5"></a>

<p>
The Speech Synthesiser for the Psion Organiser, uses this
allophone method of "talking". A vocabulary of over 900
words has been built up using these allophones and is
available for immediate use.
</p>

<p>
A full description of allophones and how to use them will
be found in Appendix B. It will only be necessary to read
that section if you intend to create your own vocabulary.
</p>

<p>
When the software is first loaded, it will automatically
intercept all diary alarms and read them out. This is
because the software can read directly off the screen, and,
when a diary alarm occurs, the text is displayed on the
screen.
</p>

<p>
Imagine the diary entry "Check a/c has 200". The string
is split up into distinct items. These items are words,
numbers and special characters. Each item ends when a
delimiter is detected. The delimiter depends on what the
item is.
</p>

<p>
Words start with a letter and continue until something
that is not a letter is detected. In the above example the
first word is "Check" because there is a space after the
"k", but also notice that the "a" from "a/c" will be treated
as a word in its own right, as will "c". The end of the string
also terminates a word. Upper &amp; lower case is irrelevant
so "CHECK", "check", "Check" and "cHeCk" are all
equivalent.
</p>

<p>
Numbers are any string of numeric characters. Scientific
notation is allowed so "1.3e-10" is valid as a number.
Numbers are terminated when anything is detected that
would cause the number to become invalid. e.g. "1.2.3" is
<a id="p1-6"></a>
treated as two numbers, "1.2" and "0.3" because the
second decimal point terminated the first number.
</p>

<p>
Special characters, are usually the delimiters themselves,
and are almost always 1 character long. The special case
is space, where multiple spaces are treated as a single
space.
</p>

<p>
When a word is detected it is looked up in the vocabulary
file to see how to pronounce it. The software will look in
ONLY two vocabulary files for each word. It will look first
in your own vocabulary file and if it is not found there, or
if you have not defined your own file, or if the software
cannot find your file, then the word is looked up in the
inbuilt vocabulary. If the word is not found there then the
word is spelt out letter by letter.
</p>

<p>
The range of words available in the in-built vocabulary file
is too large to print in this manual. Indeed, the vocabulary
may vary for custom versions of this software. A program
that will list the entire contents of the inbuilt vocabulary
is given in Appendix A.
</p>

<p>
Obviously there will be some words you use often that will
not be in the inbuilt vocabulary, and these you will have
to add to your own file. Details on how to do this are in
Chapter 6. Note however that it is unadvisable to make
your own vocabulary file too large since this will have an
adverse affect on the speed with which the software will
be able to find the next word before it has to say it. If at
all possible, create several small vocabulary files and
switch between them, either under program control, or,
via the SETUP option within the SPEECH menu item.
</p>

<a id="p1-7"></a>

<p>
Numbers are treated in different ways depending how the
software has been configured. Suffice it to say a number
like "200" can be pronounced as "two zero zero", "two
hundred" or even "two hundred pounds". See chapter 5
(CCY option) for more details.
</p>

<p>
Special characters are ignored by default and they will not
cause any output from the speech synthesiser. However,
the software can be set up so that each delimiter does
cause output. See chapter 5 (TEXT option) for more
details.
</p>

<a id="p2-1"></a>

<a id="s2"></a><h2>Section 2 - User Guide</h2>

<a id="c5"></a><h3>5. Using SETUP</h3>

<p>
When you select the SETUP option, you are presented
with a full list of the parameters which alter the way in
which the Speech Synthesiser operates. The list is
arranged with the name of the parameter on the left of the
line and the current setting on the right. Use the up &amp;
down arrow keys to scroll up and down the list.
</p>

<p>
The SETUP parameters and the things they set are as
follows:
</p>

<table class="pad">
<tbody><tr><td>VOCAB</td><td>User defined vocabulary file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>CCY  </td><td>Currency name used in amounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TEXT </td><td>Enables/disables pronunciation of punctuation characters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PAUSE</td><td>Delay used when spelling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>VIDEO</td><td>Enables/disables reading of onscreen text.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SETUP</td><td>Allows you to free up the 19 bytes of allocated memory where your preferred setups are always held.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
To edit a parameter value, first select the parameter using
the UP and DOWN keys. The selected parameter is
indicated with a "&gt;" symbol after the parameter name.
Change the selected parameter by pressing the RIGHT
<a id="p2-2"></a>
&amp; LEFT keys to select a value from a list or by pressing
EXE &amp; then entering a value. Which method you use
depends upon which parameter you are changing, see
below under the relevant heading.
</p>

<p>
Pressing ON/CLEAR sets the selected parameter to its
original value.
</p>

<h4>VOCAB</h4>

<p>
The Speech Synthesiser works by looking up each word
that it wants to say in an inbuilt dictionary file. Appendix
A contains a small program that will list the contents of
this inbuilt file. If the word is not found, then it is spelt out
letter by letter. This can become tedious, so, a mechanism
exists for creating your own vocabulary file (see chapter
6 on the Editor), and telling the speech synthesiser where
your file is. In fact your file will be searched BEFORE the
inbuilt vocabulary therefore it is possible to redefine
words that already exist, for example, when "Bath" is
looked up it can be made to say "B - AH - TH" rather
than "B - AR - TH" or even more extreme when
"pavement" is looked up it could say "sidewalk" !
</p>

<p>
The VOCAB parameter is used to indicate to the speech
synthesiser software where this user defined file is, and
what it is called.
</p>

<p>
If the VOCAB parameter is supplied then it must be a full
filename, i.e. complete with a device name. The speech
synthesiser software will not search packs looking for
your file. It expects it to be on the pack you say it is &amp; if it
can't find it, then there is no warning or error, it simply
carries on. If the software cannot find your file and the
<a id="p2-3"></a>
word doesn't exist in the inbuilt vocabulary, then the word
is spelt out letter by letter. This is the only indication you
will get that there may be a problem with this parameter.
</p>

<p>
It should also be noted that this file should ONLY contain
data generated using the allophone editor. If for example
you set this parameter to be A:MAIN and you already
use that file to hold names/addresses, then you will cause
the speech synthesiser to treat those names and address
as its own database, which will cause strange noises to be
emitted. No actual harm will occur to the speech
synthesiser, it will just not talk properly.
</p>

<p>
To change this parameter, either the LEFT or RIGHT
arrow must be pressed. This "steps" the cursor into the
field. Initially the field will have shown "None" and thus
there is nothing there to edit. If a filename had already
been specified, it will be presented for editing.
</p>

<p>
The following keys have special meaning in edit mode. Up
arrow moves to the left end of the word, down arrow
moves to the right hand side, left &amp; right arrows move left
and right, clear clears, delete deletes the character to the
left, shift delete deletes the character to the right, any
other characters get inserted at the cursor position. Exe
is used to terminate the edit.
</p>

<p>
You must enter something that looks like a valid filename
otherwise an error will be displayed &amp; you will be left to
correct your mistake. Note that it is not necessary for the
file to exist. This parameter can be reset to "None" by
using ON/CLEAR to clear the field &amp; then EXE to
terminate the edit.
</p>

<a id="p2-4"></a>

<h4>CCY</h4>

<p>
The LEFT &amp; RIGHT arrows can be used to toggle this
parameter through the valid settings. This parameter
affects how the speech synthesiser will treat numbers.
</p>

<table class="pad">
<tbody><tr><td>OFF<br>(Default)</td><td>each digit in the number is treated as a separate entity.<br>
            Consider the number 12.345<br>
            When this parameter is set to OFF, this
            number will be pronounced as "one two
            point three four five".<br>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>NONE</td><td>the number is now treated in a more English manner.<br>
            Consider the number 12.345<br>
            When this parameter is set to NONE, this
            number will be pronounced as "twelve point
            three four five". The software knows about
            numbers up to 999,999,999,999 so will can
            also say hundred thousand and million as
            appropriate.<br>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>POUNDS<br>&nbsp;&amp;<br>DOLLARS</td><td>the number is now treated as a currency
           amount. The number will be rounded to two decimal places, (12.345 becomes 12.35)
            and then treated in an English manner
            throughout, to be pronounced as "twelve
            pounds thirty five" or "twelve dollars thirty
            five". A single pound or dollar will cause the
            "s" to be dropped, as one would expect.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<a id="p2-5"></a>

<h4>PAUSE</h4>

<p>
The LEFT &amp; RIGHT arrows can be used to toggle this
parameter through the range of valid values. This pause
length is used between each letter when spelling out
unknown words. By default it is set to PA2 which may be
a little too fast for some people. The full list of values and
the corresponding delay times in milli-seconds are :-
</p>

<p class="indent">
   PA1 = 10 mS
   <br>PA2 = 30 mS (Default)
   <br>PA3 = 50 mS
   <br>PA4 = 100 mS
   <br>PA5 = 200 mS
</p>

<h4>TEXT</h4>

<p>
The LEFT &amp; RIGHT arrows can be used to toggle this
parameter ON or OFF. It will normally be left OFF. This
parameter is analogous to transparent text mode found
on some terminals. Every character as it is found is
treated as an entity in its own right. Words will always be
spelt out, numbers will be spoken a digit at a time - this
parameter overrides the setting of CCY and will make
CCY behave as if it had been set to OFF; but more
importantly all punctuation characters will be spoken as
well.
</p>

<p>
Eight bit ASCII will be converted to seven bit ASCII,
therefore it is not possible to pronounce the extended
character set.
</p>

<p>
The default value for this parameter is OFF.
</p>

<a id="p2-6"></a>

<h4>VIDEO</h4>

<p>
The LEFT &amp; RIGHT arrows can be used to toggle this
parameter ON or OFF. When ON text that is displayed
on screen will be output through the speech synthesiser.
There are two other conditions that must be fulfilled. The
screen image must not change for a period of 2 seconds,
and there must be no packs being accessed at the time.
When OFF this video interception is disabled.
</p>

<p>
The default value for this parameter is ON.
</p>

<h4>SETUP</h4>

<p>
Normally this parameter will be set to SAVED. This
means that when you remove the speech synthesiser, and
the software driver, your setups will remain saved in
memory. These setups take up 19 bytes of memory. On
the LZ range, they show up when using the Info option
in the Utils sub-menu. If you do not wish to have your
setups saved in this fashion, then toggle this parameter to
LOST by using the LEFT or RIGHT arrow. You must
then leave SETUP (see next section) switch off the
Organiser, unplug the synthesiser unit, and press
On/Clear twice. Your setups will then not be saved. If you
simply set this parameter to LOST, return to the top level
menu and press On/Clear twice (maybe by mistake) then
this parameter will have reverted back to SAVED. This
is because, the second hit of On/Clear caused all devices
to unload, and then reload, and the loading of the
synthesiser software causes this parameter to be set to
SAVED.
</p>

<p>
The default value for this parameter is SAVED.
</p>

<a id="p2-7"></a>

<a id="c5-1"></a><h3>5.1 Leaving SETUP</h3>

<p>
When the parameters have been set to the required
values, press the MODE key and a menu containing the
following items is presented:-
</p>

<table class="pad">
<tbody><tr><td>EXIT   </td><td>Exit SETUP keeping any changes.<br>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>ABANDON</td><td>Exit SETUP discarding any changes.<br>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>EDIT   </td><td>Return to the parameter list to continue editing.<br>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>RESET  </td><td>Reset to the default SETUP settings.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Pressing EXE selects the EXIT item which exits SETUP
making the adjusted parameters current.
</p>

<p>
If you have been experimenting with the SETUP parameter
editor, it is a good idea to set all the parameters
back to their original values by selecting RESET.
</p>

<a id="c6"></a><h3>6. The EDITOR</h3>

<p>
The Editor is used to edit your own personalised vocabulary
files. It can find, amend, delete or enter existing words
in your file.
</p>

<p>
As mentioned in the introduction, the speech synthesiser
operates using allophones. The editor is used to build
sounds up from the allophones and to assign the sound
to a word. This word and string of allophones is then
saved in a file for later use by the speech synthesiser
software. In this way, the known vocabulary can be
<a id="p2-8"></a>
extended from the basic vocabulary supplied, to include
your own specialised words.
</p>

<a id="c6-1"></a><h3>6.1 Using the EDITOR</h3>

<p>
Imagine now you want to add a word to your own vocabulary
file. The following gives a step by step guide to
adding a new word. A more comprehensive description
of each editor function is given in section 6.2 which should
be treated as a reference section.
</p>

<p>
Select "Editor" from the SPEECH sub-menu. If you have
already told the software what filename you are using -
either using the SETUP menu item, or a call to SAYSETUP:
then that filename will be presented to you for
confirmation, or amendment. If you haven't entered a
filename, then you must enter one here. Entering or
changing an existing filename will not actually modify the
parameters displayed by SETUP. To make use of any
words you create during the edit session, then you must
change the VOCAB parameter either by manually changing
it with the SETUP menu option or by calling
SAYSETUP: from within a program.
</p>

<p>
A blank filename will cause the editor to exit back to the
SPEECH sub-menu. Remember, the filename must contain
a valid device letter, (A:, B: or C:).
</p>

<p>
The editor is a bit more selective than setup about what
can be entered as a file name. If you had supplied a name
like "C:MYFILE" in the setup option, then, there must
at least be a pack plugged into the bottom slot for the
editor to get further.
</p>

<a id="p2-9"></a>

<p>
After the filename is entered, you are placed directly into
edit mode. If you have specified a file that already exists,
then the first word in that file will be displayed ready for
editing. If the file you specify does not yet exist, you will
be prompted with the message "Create? Y/N". Entering
"N" will return you back to the SPEECH sub-menu.
Entering a "Y" will create the file and you will be placed
in edit mode. For a new or empty file you will be presented
with a blank screen.
</p>

<p>
Whatever happened above, the cursor will be flashing on
the bottom line of the screen at the left hand side.
</p>

<p>
Assume you want to use the word "penknife". It may not
be necessary. The two words "pen" and "knife" already
exist. If you use the word "pen-knife" on screen or as an
argument to SAY: the software will look up both parts of
the word, and say "penknife". Therefore there is no real
need to create that word. The hyphen acts as a delimiter,
thus causing the software to treat each part of the word
separately.
</p>

<p>
Many words can by built up in this way, e.g. "block-ing".
Assume we want to add the word "ORIENTAL". We
could start by looking for a similar word. Press MODE,
then "F" and the "Find:" prompt appears, type in
"ENTAL" followed by EXE - maybe we already have
something like "CONTINENTAL", or "MENTAL".
Doing a search like this may save us some work. If no
match is found, a message "NOT FOUND" is briefly
displayed and the editor returns to edit mode. If a word is
found, it is displayed ready for editing. To find the next
occurrence of the word, hit MODE again, then "F". The
last search key is still there, so just hit EXE, and the next
<a id="p2-10"></a>
occurrence is returned. If there is only one occurrence
on file, then you will keep getting the same one.
</p>

<p>
Assume the above "Find" operation didn't find anything,
and we have to put the whole thing in. So that the rest of
this step-by-step lesson makes sense, if the above "Find"
did find something, you should delete all the allophones
by pressing On/Clear,
</p>

<p>
The next thing to do, is to add the word. Hit MODE then
"W", and the "Word:" prompt will appear. If the above
"Find" operation found something, then it can be deleted
by hitting On/Clear. Now type in "ORIENTAL". It
doesn't matter if it is in upper or lower case, because it
will be converted to upper case by the editor.
</p>

<p>
Next the allophones have to be added.
</p>

<p>
Type "O", "R", space. After the space is hit, the
synthesiser will say the sound corresponding to the
allophone OR.
</p>

<p>
Type "I", "Y", space. After the space is hit, the
synthesiser will say the whole word so far generated.
</p>

<p>
Next type "EH", "EH". Don 't forget the space after each
allophone mnemonic. The "EH" allophone is a bit special
in that several can be placed together to increase the
length of the sound. It is not possible to do this with all
allophones. Only the ones indicated in Appendix B have
this property.
</p>

<p>
Next type "N", "N". At this point the editor knows that
the next character will either be a space or a number. It
<a id="p2-11"></a>
will automatically shift the keyboard into numeric mode,
so when you type "U", it actually comes out as a "1".
</p>

<p>
Finally type in "TT2" and "EL".
</p>

<p>
We now have a basic word. It doesn't sound that good.
Using the left arrow move down the word so that the
cursor is on the "IY". As the cursor moves, the word is
spoken out. Another way of hearing the word again and
again is to simply hit the space or exe keys. Any other
alphabetic keys cause that character to be output on the
screen as part of an allophone. Also, the DEL key will
delete the allophone the cursor is on completely. The
On/Clear key deletes the whole string of allophones. Type
in "RR1". As you type, the string of allophones expands
to accept the new allophone.
</p>

<p>
Using the right arrow move the cursor up to a "EH"
allophone. Hit the DEL key. The "EH" allophone
disappears, the word sounds a little better, but maybe the "T"
sound it too strong. Move the cursor up to the "TT2"
allophone and hit the down arrow. The up and down
arrows are used to get allophones of a similar sound.
</p>

<p>
If you are now happy with the sound, hit the Mode key.
This brings up the Editor sub-menu. Hit "S" for save, and
the word is stored away for immediate use. After saving,
the word is still available for editing should you wish to
add suffixes or prefixes.
</p>

<a id="c6-2"></a><h3>6.2 EDITOR Reference</h3>

<p>
On entry, you will be prompted for a file in which to save
all words as they are generated. If you have already told
<a id="p2-12"></a>
the software what filename you are using - either using
the SETUP menu item, or a call to SAYSETUP: then that
filename will be presented to you for confirmation, or
amendment. A blank filename will cause the editor to exit
back to the SPEECH sub-menu.
</p>

<p>
After the filename is entered, you are placed directly into
edit mode. If you have specified a file that already exists,
then the first word in that file will be displayed ready for
editing. E.g
</p>

<p>
On CM&amp;XP
</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="screen">ABLE           &nbsp;
<u>E</u>Y BB1 PA1 EL   </span></p>

<p>
On LZ and LZ64
</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="screen"><u>&lt;              8:50a</u>
                   &nbsp;
ABLE               &nbsp;
<u>E</u>Y BB1 PA1 EL       </span></p>

<p>
The cursor will be under the "E" of EY.
</p>

<p>
If the file you specify does not yet exist, you will be
prompted with the message "Create? Y/N". Entering
"N" will return you back to the SPEECH sub-menu.
Entering a "Y" will create the file and you will be placed
in edit mode. For a new or empty file you will be presented
<a id="p2-13"></a>
with a blank screen, but, the cursor will be flashing on the
bottom line of the screen.
</p>

<p>
All editing is done on the bottom line of the screen. The
line before the last line, will show the word that this sound
will be saved as. You can use the left and right arrow
keys to move up and down the word, and as the cursor
moves through the word it is pronounced an allophone
at the time.
</p>

<p>
Allophones are entered simply by typing the allophone
mnemonic.
</p>

<p>
A full list of all the allophones and the sounds they
produce is given in Appendix B. When entering an allophone
there is no need to worry about shifting between
letters and digits. The editor will handle this for you. The
editor thinks that all allophones are 3 characters long, so
if you need to use a 2 character allophone then the final
character MUST be a space. If you mis-type a character,
then the DEL key can be used to delete the character,
and if the allophone mnemonic doesn't exist, then the
editor will simply delete it after to you end it.
</p>

<p>
Certain keys have special meaning during editing of
allophones, and these are summarised below.
</p>

<table class="pad">
<tbody><tr><td>Up&nbsp;Arrow<br>Down&nbsp;Arrow</td><td>changes the current allophone into an
            allophone from the same "family". These
            families are, Stops, Fricatives, Affricates,
            Nasals, Resonants, High, Middle and Low
            vowels, and finally Pauses. Some of these
            families of sounds are quite small, for
            example affricates has just the CH and JH
            sounds. If you keep hitting the same arrow
<a id="p2-14"></a>
            key, you will eventually get back to the
            original allophone mnemonic, it will take
            longer with some families than others. It is
            not possible to use the arrow keys to jump
            into another family. The families are
            structured so that mnemonics ending in
            digits are sequential, so if the cursor is on
            for example GG1, UP ARROW will change
            it to GG2, and again to GG3. Conversely if
            the cursor is on for example KK3, DOWN
            ARROW will change it to KK2 and again to
            KK1.<br>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>DEL</td><td>deletes the current allophone.<br>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>On/Clear</td><td>clears the whole line of allophones.<br>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mode&nbsp;key</td><td>will bring up the Editor sub-menu.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h4>FIND</h4>

<p>
Find is used to locate a word within your vocabulary file.
You may wish to do this if there is a similar sounding word
to the one you wish to create, or indeed you may wish to
find a word to delete it.
</p>

<h4>SAVE</h4>

<p>
Save is used to save the currently displayed item into your
vocabulary file. A brief message "Saving..." is displayed as
the data is stored away and the editor will then return to
edit mode.
</p>

<a id="p2-15"></a>

<p>
If you have not entered a word for the string of
allophones, the save operation will terminated with an error
message.
</p>

<h4>WORD</h4>

<p>
This option allows you to enter or change the word which
will be saved in your vocabulary. The allophones will be
saved alongside this word. It is necessary to enter both
the word, and the allophones for the system to work
correctly.
</p>

<p>
When selected the current word (if any) will be made
available for editing, and the standard Psion editing rules
apply. Up arrow moves to the left end of the word, down
arrow moves to the right hand side, left &amp; right arrows
move left and right, clear clears, delete deletes the
character to the left, shift delete deletes the character to the
right, any other characters get inserted at the cursor
position. Exe is used to terminate the edit.
</p>

<p>
Before accepting the word, the editor performs some
simple validation. Any leading or trailing spaces will be
automatically stripped from the word entered. The word
is then scanned to ensure that it only contains alphabetic
characters. It is not possible to enter hyphenated words,
or words containing any digits or special characters. The
reason is that, when the software is scanning the screen
looking for things to say, a dash or hyphen acts as a
delimiter. So, even if the editor did allow the entry of
hyphenated words, then would never be sought in the
vocabulary file. If you need hyphenated words, create two
words, one for each part.
</p>

<a id="p2-16"></a>

<h4>DELETE</h4>

<p>
This deletes the current item from the vocabulary file.
</p>

<p>
After selecting this option you will be prompted "Sure?
Y/N". Entering "Y" will cause the current item to be
deleted. Entering "N" will return you into edit mode.
Although this will appear to work 100% of the time, to
really delete the word, it is necessary to have first found
the entry using the "Find" option detailed above.
</p>

<h4>EXIT</h4>

<p>
When selected you will be prompted "Exit? Y/N". Entering
"Y" will cause the program to return to the SPEECH
menu display. Entering "N" will return you into edit
mode. All other characters are ignored.

<a id="s3"></a><h2>Section 3 - Programmers Guide</h2>

<a id="c7"></a><h3>7. Programmers Guide</h3>

<p>
This chapter assumes that you are familiar with the
Organiser programming language (OPL). For the LZ
range of Organisers, OPL is described fully in the
Programming Manual, and for the CM and XP models, it is
described in detail in the Operating Manual that came
with your Organiser.
</p>

<p>
When the Speech Synthesiser is fitted to the Organiser,
OPL programs may directly access the speech synthesiser
by making calls to the OPL language extensions. These
are summarised below.
</p>

<table class="pad">
<tbody><tr><td>SAYSETUP</td><td>Sets the speech synthesiser parameters.<br>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>SAY     </td><td>Says a string.<br>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>SAYALLO </td><td>Pronounces one or more allophones.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Note that the user can abort any of these functions by
pressing ON/CLEAR, in which case the error 206 (Escape)
will be raised. This feature can be disabled by using
the ESCAPE OFF command.
</p>

<p>
If any other error occurs an error is "raised" in the
normal way. See the Error Handling chapter in your
Organiser manual for a description of OPL error handling
facilities. If the OPL program does not trap errors,
the program will terminate when an error occurs,
<a id="p3-2"></a>
displaying an error message that corresponds to the error
number.
</p>

<p>
The following procedures names are used internally:
</p>

<p class="indent code">SPEECH
SPEECHST
SPEECHDG</p>

<p>
and you should avoid using these names for your own
procedures.
</p>

<a id="c7-1"></a><h3>7.1 SAYSETUP</h3>

<p>
The SAYSETUP procedure is used to change or set the
current operating parameters without having to use the
SETUP option under the SPEECH menu item. Parameters
which are changed by SAYSETUP remain changed
when the OPL program terminates.
</p>

<p>
The syntax is :-
</p>

<p class="indent code">SAYSETUP:(vocab$,ccy%,pause%,text%,alarm%)</p>

<p>
The meaning of the parameters are described fully in
chapter 5 "Using Setup". Except for the trailing % and $,
the names of the procedure parameter names used here,
correspond to the parameter names used in that section.
It is not possible by using a call to SAYSETUP: to
configure the software to lose the 19 bytes of memory used
to save the setups. It is only possible to change this
parameter by using the SPEECH sub-menu item SETUP.
</p>

<a id="p3-3"></a>

<p>
Any procedure parameter may be set to -1 in which case
the current value of that parameter is not changed by the
call to SAYSETUP.
</p>

<p>
For example, the line :-
</p>

<p class="indent code">SAYSETUP:(-1,-1,1,-1,-1)</p>

<p>
sets the PAUSE parameter to 1 without affecting the
current setting of the other SETUP parameters.
</p>

<p>
If there are trailing parameters which you do not wish to
change, then they may be omitted. The line :-
</p>

<p class="indent code">SAYSETUP:(-1,-1,1)</p>

<p>
has the same effect as the previous example, and another
example:-
</p>

<p class="indent code">SAYSETUP:("a:myfile")</p>

<p>
resets the user vocabulary file to "a:myfile".
</p>

<p>
Omitting all the parameters to SAYSETUP: is a special
case &amp; has the effect of restoring the complete set of
parameters to their default values.
</p>

<p>
As in SETUP, the speech parameters may only take their
value from a list of allowed values.
</p>

<a id="p3-4"></a>

<table class="pad">
<tbody><tr><th>Parameter   </th><th>Default  </th><th>Allowed values</th></tr>
<tr><td>vocab$      </td><td>Empty string</td><td>Any valid file name. A device must be specified. The file does not have to exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ccy%        </td><td>0        </td><td>0 to 3. (Off, None, Pounds, Dollars).</td></tr>
<tr><td>pause%      </td><td>1        </td><td>0 to 4. (PA1, PA2, PA3, PA4, PAS)</td></tr>
<tr><td>text%       </td><td>0        </td><td>0 to 1. (Off, On)</td></tr>
<tr><td>video%      </td><td>1        </td><td>0 to 1 (Off, On)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
An example:-
</p>

<p class="indent code">SAYSETUP:(-1,2)</p>

<p>
sets the currency to Pounds.
</p>

<p>
The default action of the Speech Synthesiser is to read
out all on-screen text. You may wish to disable this function
whilst your program is running, and restore it again
after the program terminates. You will need two calls
like:-
</p>

<p class="program">MYPROG:
SAYSETUP:(-1,-1,-1,-1,0)
    REM Your code goes here
SAYSETUP:(-1,-1,-1,-1,1)</p>

<p>
It might be prudent to remind you at this stage, that if you
are using many "-1" parameters it is more efficient to use
<a id="p3-5"></a>
"SFFFF" instead. However, if you are in the habit of
keeping the OPL source code in your Organiser along
with the object code, then the 1 byte of object code saved
by using $FFFF instead of -1 is offset by the 3 extra bytes
needed to hold the extra source. The decision is up to you
and how you work.
</p>

<a id="c7-2"></a><h3>7.2 SAY</h3>

<p>
The SAY procedure is the procedure that will be used
most often. The OPL statement :-
</p>

<p class="indent code">SAY:('good morning')</p>

<p>
will do just that.
</p>

<p>
As with all string based parameters, there is a limit of 255
characters to the string. Therefore, if you need to say
more than this in one part of your program, then you will
need to make two or more consecutive calls. All the
rules in the setup, such as the way numbers are
pronounced &amp; transparent text are obeyed.
</p>

<p>
If it is necessary to have some words spelt out whilst
others are spoken, it will be necessary to intersperse calls
to SAY: with calls to SAYSETUP:. However, it is unlikely
that this will be necessary, but obviously it will depend on
your application.
</p>

<a id="c7-3"></a><h3>7.3 SAYALLO</h3>

<p>
This is a more primitive function that SAY: &amp; is unlikely
to be used, but it is documented here for completion. It is
<a id="p3-6"></a>
used to pronounce single or multiple allophones. Each
allophone is specified by its decimal value. A complete list
of allophones can be found in Appendix B. Any attempt
to specify an allophone outside the valid range (0 to 63)
will simply cause the number to be truncated to the least
significant 6 bits thus bringing it into the range 0 to 63.
Each allophone is separated from its neighbour by any
non-numeric, so :-
</p>

<p class="indent code">SAYALLO:("27,7,45,0,45,53")
SAYALLO:("27 7 45 0 45 53")
SAYALLO:("27a7B45,,45.53")</p>

<p>
are all equivalent, and
</p>

<p class="indent code">SAYALLO:('HELLO')</p>

<p>
is equivalent to six PA1 allophones.
</p>

<a id="pA-1"></a>

<a id="cA"></a><h3>Appendix A.</h3>

<p>
The inbuilt vocabulary file can be accessed using the
following program - which will work on either the CM,
XP, or LZ range; and will list the entire contents of the
file before terminating. The inbuilt file is sorted in
alpha-numeric sequence.
</p>

<p class="program">VOCAB:
ESCAPE ON
OPEN "d:vocab",a.w$
WHILE NOT EOF
   PRINT a.w$
   NEXT
ENDWH</p>

<p>
You may stop the program at any time by pressing
On/Clear followed by Q.
</p>

<p>
To obtain a hardcopy of the inbuilt vocabulary is a little
more difficult. The vocabulary has to first be copied to the
internal RAM (A:) or to a datapack, and printed from
there using Comms Link. Unfortunately, it is not possible
to use the Copy function provided in the top level menu
(on XP/CM) or in the Xfiles sub-menu on the LZ range.
A simple program has to be written. Thus :-
</p>

<p class="program">CYVOCAB:
IF EXIST("a:vocab") :DELETE "a:vocab" :ENDIF
COPY "d:vocab","a:"</p>

<a id="pA-2"></a>

<p>
After that program as been run, the following program
can be used to generate a hardcopy of the vocabulary.
</p>

<p class="program">PRVOCAB:
LOCAL fil$(10),a$(20),l%,l$(1)
fil$="a:vocab"
OPEN fil$,a,w$
WHILE NOT EOF
   a$=a.w$
   IF l$&lt;&gt;LEFT$(a$,1)
      l$=LEFT$(a$,1) :i%=0
      LPRINT : LPRINT
   ELSEIF (I% AND 3) = 0
      LPRINT
   ENDIF
   WHILE LEN(a$)&lt;15
      a$=a$+" "
   ENDWH
   LPRINT a$," ";
   l%=l%+1
   NEXT
ENDWH
LPRINT
LPRINT
LPRINT "Total words=",COUNT</p>

<a id="pB-1"></a>

<a id="cB"></a><h3>Appendix B</h3>

<p>
In order to successfully use a set of allophone sounds to
synthesise words, there are a few preliminary points
which should be made about speech and language. First,
there is no one-to-one correspondence between written
letters and the sounds of a language; second, speech
sounds are not discrete units as beads on a string, and
lastly, speech sounds are acoustically different depending
on what position in a word they occur, and what sounds
precede or follow them.
</p>

<p>
The first of these is a problem which a child encounters
when learning to read. Each sound in a language may be
represented by more than one letter, and conversely,
each letter may represent more than one sound. E. g.
"meet" is an example of the former whilst "people" is an
example of the latter for just the letter "e". Because of
these spelling irregularities we must be careful to think in
terms of sounds not letters, when dealing with speech.
</p>

<p>
The second point to be made concerns segmentation of
the speech signal. An adult who has learnt how to read
usually thinks of the acoustic stream of speech as a string
of discrete sounds which he/she calls by the letter names.
But, in fact, speech is a continuously varying signal which
cannot be easily broken into distinct sound-size units. For
example, if one attempts to extract the "b" from "bat" by
taking successively larger chunks of signal from the
beginning of the word, one at first hears a non-speech noise,
and then at some point hears "ha". In other words, there
is no point at which the "b" sound can be heard in
<a id="pB-2"></a>
isolation; one hears either a non-speech sound, or the
syllable "ba".
</p>

<p>
Finally, the most important point to make for users of the
allophone set, is that the acoustic signal of a speech sound
may differ depending on whether it occurs in word initial
or word final position; or in the environment of a vowel
which is articulated in the front or back of the mouth, a
long or short vowel, or a voiced or voiceless consonant.
For example, the initial "p" in "pop" will be acoustically
different from the "p" in "spy", and may be different from
the final "p" in "pop". Furthermore, the ear will perceive
the same acoustic signal differently depending on what
sounds precede or follow it. The word "cot" can be made
to sound like "cod" by lengthening the duration of the
"o", and the converse is also true.
</p>

<p>
It will be useful to know what the speech sounds of
English are. The sounds of a language are called
phonemes, and each language has a set which is slightly
different from those of other languages. It is for this
reason, that the Speech Synthesiser only supports the
English language, and even then, says it with an American
accent. (The speech processor chip is of American design).
</p>

<p>
It will be useful to remember that sounds which have
features in common behave in similar ways. For example,
the voiceless stop consonants "PP", "TT" and "KK"
require 50 to 80 msec of silence before them and the
voiced stop consonants "BB", "DD" and "GG" require
10 to 30 msec of silence before them. When you find a
particular technique that works well with one sound, try
using that same technique with similar sounds. For
example, if you decide that "KK1" sounds good before a
<a id="pB-3"></a>
front vowel ("IY"), use it before other front vowels
("YR", "IY", "IH", "EY", "EH", "XR", "AE").
</p>

<p>
The allophone set contains 2 or 3 versions of some
phonemes. You may find that you need to use one allophone
or particular phoneme for word, or syllable, initial
position and another for word or syllable final position.
The following pages give a complete list of the allophone
set together with a set of guidelines for using them. Note
that these are suggestions and not rules.
</p>

<p>
One of the differences between initial and final position
versions of a consonant is that the initial version may be
longer. Therefore, to create an initial SS, you can use two
"SS"s instead of the usual single SS at the end of a word
or syllable, as in "sister". Note that this can be done with
TH and FF and inherently short vowels, but with no other
consonants. You will want to experiment with some
consonant clusters to discover which versions work best in
the cluster. For example KK1 sounds good before LL as
in "clown", and KK2 sounds good before WW as in
"square". One allophone of a particular phoneme may
sound better before or after back vowels and another
before or after front vowels. KK3 sounds good before
UH and KK1 sounds good before IY. Some sounds (PP,
BB, TT, DD, KK, GG, CH and JH) require a brief
duration of silence before them. For the most, the silence
has already been added, but you may decide to add more.
Remember that you must always think about how the
word sounds, not how it is spelt For example, the NG
allophone obviously belongs at the end of the words
"sing" and "long", but notice that it is represented by the
letter N in "uncle". Finally remember that some sounds
may not even be represented in words by any letters, as
the YY in "computer".
